Issue Tracker - 

Light Sense:

    Layout -
        1. USB port does not fit - please fix.
        2. Increase the trace widths for power on the board.

    Finishing -
        1. Do not need the 25R resistor. Can be removed.

Airsense:

    Layout -
        1. F2 is of the wrong size.
        2. You can remove the funnyness around the T3 section.
        3. Increase trace-widths for power - all over the place.
        4. Change the power splitter circuit we have now.
        5. Fix the voltage divider around HIH4030
        6. Check if we have the right fuses - may be we need higher as the
            Chemsense gets power off of the Airsense.
        7. Remove the USB lines from ESDA2
        8. Change the HBT line to 5V instead of 3.3V it is now in.
        9. Fix the power for the EEPROM.
        10. Change Mic RAW Location to before the Capacitor.

    Finishing -

        1. Change resistors for HIH4030 - Curves need changing the resistors. R1
            + R2 should be greater than 39 kÎ©.
