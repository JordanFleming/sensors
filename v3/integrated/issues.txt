Light Sense:

    Layout -
        1. USB port does fit - please fix.
        2. Increase the trace widths for power on the board.

    Finishing -
        1. Do not need the 25R resistor. Can be removed.

Airsense:

    Layout -
        1. F2 is of the wrong size.
        2. You can remove the funnyness around the T3 section.
        3. Increase tracewidths for power - all over the place.
        4. Change the power splitter circuit we have now.
        5. Fix the voltage divider around HIH4030
        6. Check if we have the right fuses - may be we need more as the Chemsense sponges off of the Airsense.
        7. Remove the USB lines from ESDA2
        8. Change the HBT line to 5V instead of 3.3 it is now in.
        9. Fix the power for the EEPROM.
