Issue Tracker -

Light Sense:

    Layout -
        1. USB port does not fit - please fix.
        2. Increase the trace widths for power on the board.

    Finishing -
        1. Do not need the 25R resistor. Can be removed.

Airsense:

    Layout -
        1. Check the UART link with Chemsense. 
        2. Simplify T3 section.
        3. Increase trace-widths for incoming power.
        4. Fix - power convergence error spotted in last rev.
        5. Fix - Stray short around MOSFET.
        6. Fix - Remove the USB lines from ESDA2.
        7. Fix - HBT line to 5V instead of 3.3V.
        8. Fix - EEPROM Power.
        9. Fix - Remove Capacitor in the Mic circuit.



    Finishing -

        1. Change resistors for HIH4030 - Curves need changing the resistors. R1
            + R2 should be greater than 39 kÎ©.
