\section{Physical Connections and Interfaces}

`v3 sensor boards with alpha sensor' means a set of sensors which includs a v3.1 Metsense board, a v3.1 Lightsense board, a Chemsense board, and a alpha sensor.
\par
Physical connections between sensor boards and alpha sensor are shown in the Figure \ref{fig:physicalConnections}. The metsense board is connected to the lightsense board and the chemsense board through CAT6 cable. The metsense and the lightsense deliver data through I2C communication, and chemsense board delivers data through serial3 communication. All sensor data from metsense, lightsense, and chemsense board are delivered to nodecontroller thourgh USB connect attached on lightsense board. Alpha sensor will be conncted to Airsense board using SPI communication line and a digital pin 1 of JP2. Then all the sensor data will be delivered through the USB connected on lighsense board.
