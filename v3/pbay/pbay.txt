** subs
Ignore it
This is just for shpark

** coresense
Get data from chemsense, through lightsense and airsense.

** integrated
Integrated version 0, using 24sec timer to get data from the chemsese board
>>>Version was used to pass MAC address only for PDT sets
Make sure to on/off PRINT_ADDRESS in "config.cpp"
(+)
Clean up the codes
In the middle of merging alphasensor
>>>HBEAT is added, switch HIGH/LOW every 1 sec
Just variables are added on config.cpp
Testing packet loss - OIX_count test (jun 30, 2016)
(+)
>>>Problem that chemsense is not powered on while it mounted on a node
Codes for alpha sensor are not included
Position of sensor_setup();
This one will be used for v3 sensors without alphasensor
-->> This is the one on the node for tests (July 5)

** v3.2
Copy of integrated (Jun 8, 2016)
Merging alphasensor
>>>Make packets for alphasensor data
Four sub-packets for alpha sensor configureation (64bytes each)
v3.1 airsense board does not have SPI SS pin, so I cannot test the whole sensors together
USE ONLY ALPHASENSOR
--> This is the one success with alpha sensor
