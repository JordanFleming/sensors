** subs
Ignore it
This is just for shpark

** coresense
Get data from chemsense, through lightsense and airsense.

** integrated
Integrated version 3.2, using 24sec timer to get data from the chemsese board
>>>Based on version 3.1 which was used to pass MAC address only for PDT sets
Make sure to on/off PRINT_ADDRESS in "config.cpp"
(+)
Clean up the codes
>>>HBEAT is added, switch HIGH/LOW every 1 sec
Just variables are added on config.cpp
Testing packet loss - OIX_count test (jun 30, 2016)
>>>Solved, the problem was because of serial data lost
Chemsense.ino will not end untill it finishs handling the last byte of each dataline from chemsense
(+)
Problem that chemsense is not powered on while it mounted on a node
>>>Solved, while loops are changed to if condition, and timeout are added
Position of sensor_setup();
>>>Caution: comments in the code
-->> This was the one on the node for tests (July 5)
(+)
Merge alphasensor codes
>>>Make packets for alphasensor data(July5)
Four sub-packets for alpha sensor configureation (64bytes each)
v3.1 airsense board does not have SPI SS pin, so I cannot test the whole sensors together
USE ONLY ALPHASENSOR
--> This is the one success with alpha sensor
>>>config.cpp: Alphasense_include need to be commented

**v3.3
Copy of integrated
Average Air/Lightsense sensor values using repeat variable
Change the condition of while loop on chemsense.ino
Add timeout for Alpha sensor detection
>>>This code will work when Alpha sensor and Chemsense are not attached, and the_sensor_include is not commented
Chemsense can be detected when it is attached or dettached, but not Alpha sensor
--> Need to be added
